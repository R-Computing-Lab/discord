# Introduction

This vignette describes how to restructure data for comparing kin. The function that takes care of this is `discord_data`, which provides a dynamic framework for determining differences between kinship pairs on a measured outcome (behavior) given a set of predictors.

We provide [Examples] of how this works with data downloaded from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979, though this could be done with any data containing kin pairs.
