# Introduction

This vignette describes kinship simulations with `discord`. The function that takes care of this is `kinsim`. It provides a highly customizable framework for creating biometrically informed multivariate data given the ACE parameters, where *A* is the additive genetic effects, *C* is the common (shared) environmental effects, and *E* is the non-shared (individual-specific) environmental effects.

Below are some use cases for different simulations.
