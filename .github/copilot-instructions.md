# GitHub Copilot Instructions for discord

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the `discord` R package, which provides functions for discordant kinship modeling and other sibling-based quasi-experimental designs. The package enables researchers to analyze within-family effects while controlling for shared familial confounders.

## Package Purpose

`discord` is designed to:
- Facilitate discordant sibling designs in research
- Prepare and structure data for kinship pair analysis
- Perform discordant regression analyses examining within-family effects
- Simulate genetically-informed data for model testing and validation
- Control for shared familial confounding factors in statistical analyses

## Project Structure

This is an R package following standard R package conventions:

- `R/` - Main source code directory containing:
  - `func_discord_data.R` - Data preparation functions
  - `func_discord_regression.R` - Regression analysis functions
  - `func_kinsim.R` - Simulation functions for genetically-informed data
  - `helpers_regression.R` - Helper functions for regression operations
  - `helpers_simulation.R` - Helper functions for simulation operations
  - `data.R` - Data documentation
  - `discord-package.R` - Package-level documentation

- `tests/testthat/` - Test suite using the testthat framework
- `man/` - Documentation files (auto-generated by roxygen2)
- `vignettes/` - Long-form documentation and tutorials
- `data/` - Package data files
- `data-raw/` - Raw data and data processing scripts
- `inst/` - Additional package files

## Development Standards

### Code Style
- **Follow the [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)** for all R code
- Use roxygen2 comments for function documentation
- Use snake_case for function and variable names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Include examples in function documentation where appropriate

### Testing
- **Use the `testthat` package** for all tests
- Tests are located in `tests/testthat/`
- All new functionality must include corresponding tests
- Run tests with `devtools::test()` or `testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat")`
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes

### Documentation
- Use roxygen2 comments (`#'`) for function documentation
- Update `README.Rmd` (not README.md directly) when making user-facing changes
- Include `@param`, `@return`, `@examples`, and `@export` tags as appropriate
- Document all exported functions
- Use `@importFrom` for specific function imports from other packages

### Dependencies
Key dependencies:
- **stats** (Imports) - Core statistical functions
- **testthat** (Suggests) - Testing framework
- **dplyr, tidyr, tidyverse** (Suggests) - Data manipulation
- **ggplot2** (Suggests) - Visualization
- **knitr, rmarkdown** (Suggests) - Documentation and vignettes
- **NlsyLinks, BGmisc** (Suggests) - Kinship-related packages

Minimal dependencies are preferred. Only add new dependencies if absolutely necessary.

## Key Concepts

### Discordant Kinship Modeling
- Analyzes differences within kinship pairs (typically siblings)
- Controls for shared familial factors (genetics, shared environment)
- Separates within-family from between-family effects
- Uses quasi-experimental design principles

### Main Functions
- `discord_data()` - Prepares data for discordant analysis
- `discord_regression()` - Performs within-family regression analysis
- `kinsim()` - Simulates genetically-informed data for kinship pairs

## Build and Check

This is a CRAN package, so it must pass R CMD check:
- Use `devtools::check()` to run R CMD check
- Ensure there are no errors, warnings, or notes
- Use `devtools::build()` to build the package
- Use `devtools::install()` to install locally for testing

## Version Management

- Current version: 1.3 (see DESCRIPTION file)
- Follow semantic versioning
- Update NEWS.md for all user-facing changes
- Version format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

## Contribution Guidelines

See CONTRIBUTING.md for full details:
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch
- Commit changes in logical chunks
- Ensure all tests pass
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation
- Follow the Code of Conduct (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Common Tasks

When working on this repository:

1. **Adding a new function**: 
   - Add to appropriate R/ file
   - Include roxygen2 documentation
   - Export if user-facing (with `@export`)
   - Add tests in tests/testthat/
   - Add examples in documentation

2. **Modifying existing function**:
   - Update roxygen2 documentation if signature changes
   - Update or add tests for new behavior
   - Check that existing tests still pass
   - Update vignettes if user-facing changes

3. **Adding dependencies**:
   - Minimize new dependencies
   - Add to DESCRIPTION under Imports or Suggests
   - Use `@importFrom` in roxygen2 comments
   - Prefer Suggests over Imports when possible

4. **Updating documentation**:
   - Edit README.Rmd (not README.md)
   - Run `devtools::document()` to regenerate .Rd files
   - Run `knitr::knit("README.Rmd")` to regenerate README.md
   - Update NEWS.md for user-facing changes

## Tips for Copilot

- This package deals with kinship data, family structures, and sibling comparisons
- Statistical terminology: "discordant" refers to differences within pairs
- "Within-family" effects are distinct from "between-family" effects
- Regression models separate these two levels of variation
- The package supports various kinship types (siblings, twins, cousins, etc.)
- Data typically comes in pair/dyad format after processing
