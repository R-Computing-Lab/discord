# Vignette Enhancements Summary

## Response to Reviewer Feedback

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the discord package vignettes in response to reviewer feedback requesting:

1. More clarity on the selection process for first-born full siblings
2. Demonstration of standard OLS regression in wide dataset
3. Specifics on difference scores and pooled regression
4. Details on sibling-specific data usage
5. Complete end-to-end workflow documentation
6. A stand-alone, comprehensive companion document

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `full_data_workflow.Rmd`

This vignette now provides a comprehensive, end-to-end guide with the following additions:

#### A. Visualization of Sibling Ordering Process (NEW)
- **Location**: Section "Visualizing the Ordering Process"
- **Content**: 
  - Shows before/after tables demonstrating how `discord_data()` reorders siblings based on outcome values
  - Concrete examples showing which sibling becomes `_1` vs `_2`
  - Clear explanation of why ordering ensures positive difference scores

#### B. First-Born vs. Outcome-Based Ordering (NEW)
- **Location**: Section "Understanding Sibling Selection vs. Outcome-Based Ordering"  
- **Content**:
  - **Fixed selection for OLS**: Explains selecting first-born or oldest sibling for standard regression
  - **Outcome-based ordering for discord models**: Explains dynamic reordering based on outcome variable
  - **Why the distinction matters**: Three concrete examples showing the same data ordered by different outcomes
  - **When to use each approach**: Clear guidance on selection strategy vs. outcome-based ordering

#### C. Complete Model Comparison (ENHANCED)
- **Location**: Section "Comparing the Three Approaches"
- **Content**:

  - Practical implications of differences between models

#### D. Enhanced Difference Score Explanation (NEW)
- **Location**: Section "Understanding the Difference Scores"

  - Verification table showing calculations match the package output
  - Interpretation guide for positive, negative, and non-significant coefficients

#### E. Comprehensive OLS Demonstration (ALREADY PRESENT, NOW ENHANCED)

  - Runs standard `lm()` with clear model specification
  - Explains what OLS captures and its limitations
  - Now better contextualized with the selection explanation

### 2. Enhanced `regression.Rmd`

This vignette now includes a complete comparative analysis framework:

#### A. Standard OLS Baseline Model (NEW)
- **Location**: Section "Model 1: Standard OLS Regression"
- **Content**:
  - Data preparation: selecting one sibling per family (`_s1`)
  - Standard individual-level regression with `lm()`
  - Full model output with confidence intervals
  - Explanation of what OLS captures and potential confounding

#### B. Between-Family Regression (NEW)
- **Location**: Section "Model 2: Between-Family Regression"
- **Content**:
  - Creating family mean variables
  - Regression using only family-level averages
  - Interpretation of between-family effects
  - Explanation of what this model can and cannot tell us

#### C. Discordant Regression (ALREADY PRESENT, NOW CONTEXTUALIZED)
- **Location**: Section "Model 3: Discordant-Kinship Regression"
- **Content**:
  - Now presented as third model in comparative framework
  - Maintains all original content and interpretation
  - Better contextualized relative to OLS and between-family models

#### D. Comprehensive Three-Model Comparison (NEW)
- **Location**: Section "Comparing All Three Models"
- **Content**:
  - Stargazer table showing all three models side-by-side
  - Custom coefficient labels for clarity
  - Side-by-side comparison makes differences immediately visible

#### E. Practical Interpretation Guide (NEW)
- **Location**: Section "Key Insights from Model Comparison"
- **Content**:
  - What each model tells us about the SES-flu vaccination relationship
  - How to interpret differences between OLS and within-family effects
  - What it means when effects differ across models
  - Practical implications for causal inference
  - Three scenarios with different interpretation patterns

## How These Changes Address Reviewer Concerns

### 1. "Visualization of selection process for first-born full siblings"
**Addressed in**: 
- `full_data_workflow.Rmd`: "Visualizing the Ordering Process" section shows before/after tables
- `full_data_workflow.Rmd`: "Understanding Sibling Selection vs. Outcome-Based Ordering" provides three concrete examples

### 2. "Show standard OLS regression in wide dataset"
**Addressed in**:
- `full_data_workflow.Rmd`: "Standard OLS Regression" section (enhanced)
- `regression.Rmd`: "Model 1: Standard OLS Regression" section (new)

### 3. "Specifics on difference scores and pooled regression"
**Addressed in**:
- `full_data_workflow.Rmd`: "Understanding the Difference Scores" section with concrete calculations
- `full_data_workflow.Rmd`: Enhanced explanation in "Understanding the Transformation" section
- Both vignettes: Detailed model equations and interpretation

### 4. "Details on sibling-specific data for interactions"
**Addressed in**:
- `full_data_workflow.Rmd`: Shows how predictor differences vary independently of outcome ordering
- Both vignettes: Demonstrate how `_1` and `_2` values are maintained correctly across ordering

### 5. "Full workflow end-to-end"
**Addressed in**:
- `full_data_workflow.Rmd`: Already comprehensive (wide → long → pedigree), now enhanced with selection clarity
- `regression.Rmd`: Now includes complete workflow from selection through all three model types

### 6. "Stand-alone, everything-you-need companion document"
**Addressed in**:
- Both vignettes now provide complete workflows with all three model types
- Side-by-side comparisons allow readers to see full picture in one place
- Clear interpretation guides make vignettes self-contained
- No need to reference external papers to understand the basic approach

## Summary Statistics

### `full_data_workflow.Rmd`
- **Added**: ~126 lines
- **New sections**: 4 major additions
- **Enhanced sections**: 2 existing sections

### `regression.Rmd`  
- **Added**: ~209 lines
- **New sections**: 5 major additions
- **Restructured**: Modeling section now comparative framework

## Code Examples Added

Both vignettes now include:
- ✅ Data selection/preparation for OLS
- ✅ Standard OLS regression with `lm()`
- ✅ Between-family regression with family means
- ✅ Discordant regression (already present)
- ✅ Side-by-side model comparison tables
- ✅ Visualization of ordering process
- ✅ Demonstration of mean/diff calculations

## Key Improvements

1. **Clarity**: Selection vs. ordering distinction is now crystal clear
2. **Completeness**: All three model types shown in both vignettes
3. **Comparability**: Side-by-side tables allow immediate comparison
4. **Visual**: Before/after tables show ordering process concretely
5. **Interpretation**: Comprehensive guides for understanding differences
6. **Pedagogical**: Progressive complexity (OLS → Between → Discord)
7. **Self-contained**: No need for external references to understand approach

## Testing Notes

Since this environment does not have R installed, the enhanced vignettes have not been knit to verify they render correctly. However:

- All code follows existing patterns in the vignettes
- All functions used (`stargazer`, `knitr::kable`, `broom::tidy`) are already used elsewhere in the vignettes
- All data transformations follow existing logic
- Syntax has been carefully checked

**Recommendation**: After merging, run `devtools::build_vignettes()` or `pkgdown::build_articles()` to verify rendering.

## Conclusion

These enhancements transform the vignettes from good documentation into comprehensive, stand-alone tutorials that:

1. Show the complete workflow from start to finish
2. Compare all relevant modeling approaches side-by-side  
3. Provide clear guidance on when and why to use each approach
4. Visualize key concepts like sibling ordering
5. Explain the statistical models and their interpretation in accessible terms

The vignettes now provide exactly what the reviewer requested: a complete companion document that gives readers everything they need to understand and implement discordant-kinship regression from beginning to end.
