`discord` is an R package that provides functions for discordant kinship
modeling and other sibling-based quasi-experimental designs. It includes
functions for data preparation, regression analysis, and simulation of
genetically-informed data. The package is designed to facilitate the
implementation of discordant sibling designs in research, allowing for
the control of shared familial confounding factors.

Visit the [discord website](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/discord/) for
more information and detailed documentation. Below is a brief overview of the package, its features, and vignettes to get you started.

## Features
- **Data Preparation**: Functions to prepare and structure data for discordant sibling analysis, including handling of kinship pairs and demographic variables.
- **Regression Analysis**: Tools to perform discordant regression analyses, allowing for the examination of within-family effects while controlling for shared familial confounders.
- **Simulation**: Functions to simulate genetically-informed data, enabling researchers to test and validate their models.

## Vignettes

The package includes several vignettes to help users understand and utilize its features effectively. 

## External Reproducible Examples

Beyond the vignettes, you can find additional examples that fully reproduce analyses from our other publications (Garrison et al 2025, etc). These examples can be accessed via the following links:

- National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) dataset
  - [Frontiers](https://github.com/R-Computing-Lab/Sims-et-al-2024): Reproduces exploring the relationship between depression and delinquency from Sims et al 2024.
  - [AMPPS](https://github.com/R-Computing-Lab/target-causalclaims): Reproduces analyses from  Garrison et al 2025, using `targets` for workflow management.

- China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) dataset
  - [AMPPS](https://github.com/R-Computing-Lab/discord_AMPSS_CFPS): Reproduces analyses from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) dataset, focusing on the association between adolescent depression and math achievement.


## Installation
