\description{
This function calculates differences and means of a given variable for each kinship pair. The order of subtraction and the variables' names in the output dataframe depend on the order column set by check_sibling_order().
If the demographics parameter is set to "race", "sex", or "both", it also prepares demographic information accordingly,
swapping the order of demographics as per the order column.
