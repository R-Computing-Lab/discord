\arguments{
\item{r_all}{Levels of relatedness; default is MZ and DZ twins c(1,.5).}

\item{npg_all}{Sample size per group; default is 500.}

\item{reliability_all}{Optional Additional error. Indicates correlation between True Y and Measured Y. Default is 1}

\item{prop_var_explained_all}{Optional Additional error. Indicates proportion of variance explained in True Y from Measured Y. Default is \code{reliability_all}^2}

\item{npergroup_all}{Vector of sample sizes by group; default repeats \code{npg_all} for all groups}

\item{mu_all}{Mean for each generated variable; default is 0.}

\item{variables}{Number of variables to generate; default is 2. Currently, limited to max of two variables.}

\item{mu_list}{List of means by variable; default repeats \code{mu_all} for all variables}

\item{reliability_list}{Vector of Reliabilities for each generated variable; default is to repeat \code{reliability_all} for each variable}

\item{prop_var_explained_list}{Vector of R^2 for each generated variable; default is to repeat \code{prop_var_explained_all} for each variable}

\item{r_vector}{Alternative, give vector of r cofficients for entire sample.}

\item{ace_all}{Vector of variance components for each generated variable; default is c(1,1,1).}

\item{ace_list}{Matrix of ACE variance components by variable, where each row is its own variable; default is to repeat \code{ace_all} for each variable.}

\item{cov_a}{Shared variance for additive genetics (a); default is 1}

\item{cov_c}{Shared variance for shared-environment (c); default is 1}

\item{cov_e}{shared variance for non-shared-environment (e); default is 1}

\item{model}{Moding type. Default is correlated factors model "Correlated"; alterative specification as a "Cholesky" model, where variable 1 accounts for variance in variable 2.}

\item{...}{Optional pass on additional inputs.}
}
